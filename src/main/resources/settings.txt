Rate determines how often the output file is scanned, lower = less latency, but may consume more resources
Numbers are in milliseconds, 1000 ms = 1 second
rate=10000

The header is printed after each status output in console, useful for distinguishing outputs
header=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n============================================

Some profiles have their visibility set to private, this application guesstimates based off other accounts that were made immediately before/after
If false, we will try to fetch, if true, we will save the estimated guess
persistGuessses=true

Source sometimes fails to print the #end of a status command. If this happens,
we will assume the status has ended after X milliseconds (-1 to disable)
